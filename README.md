# Pneumonia-CXR-Detection
Machine learning algorithm to predict pneumonia from chest x-ray

Analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. 

Medical images with clinical labels for each image that were extracted from their accompanying radiology reports.

The project included access to a GPU for fast training of deep learning architecture, 
as well as access to 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients.
